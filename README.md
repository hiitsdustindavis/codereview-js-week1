# _JS Code Review Week 1_

## Description

Using the github api:
For each repository belonging to the given user, we want to display its name, and its description (if it exists).

As you build your app, make sure to structure your project directory in a logical way, including 2 JavaScript files, and one of them should be a module using exports. Also include a basic SASS style sheet. Finally, make sure to include a README and a .gitignore file, and use all of the build tools that have been introduced this week:

Manage frontend dependencies with Bower.
Manage all our other dependencies with npm.
Write an asset pipeline with a live reloading development server in gulp.
You must include gulp tasks for:

Concatenation, minification, and running the browserify package on your JavaScript.
Building and cleaning.
Running the development server with live reloading.
Running JSHint.
Compiling SASS.
Automatically including Bower dependencies as vendor.js and vendor.css.

## Setup/Installation

1. clone the repo to your machine
2. command line: in the project top directory run:
路 npm install
路 bower install
路 gulp build
路 gulp serve
